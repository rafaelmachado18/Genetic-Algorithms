*8-Queens Genetic Algorithm Solver*

This project uses Genetic Algorithms to solve the 8-Queens puzzle. The implementation includes fitness evaluation based on non-attacking pairs, roulette wheel selection, single-point crossover, and mutation. It evolves a population of solutions until a configuration with zero collisions is found.


How to use
Compile: g++ queens.cpp -o queens

Run: ./queens
